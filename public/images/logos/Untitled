Restructure the left side content column of the hero section. 
The right side (David's photo with sunburst background) stays 
as-is. The left column content should be reordered from top 
to bottom as follows:

ORDER (top to bottom):

1. DAVID! LOGO (stacked/vertical version — specific variant)

   Use this specific logo variant:
   - The DAVID! speech bubble: RED filled (#E92128) bubble 
     with black outline, "DAVID!" in white text with black 
     3D drop shadow (the standard red version of the mark)
   - Below the speech bubble, stacked text:
     Line 1: "Democratic Socialist" — RED (#E92128), Bernoru 
     Semicondensed, bold
     Line 2: "for Hudson County" — WHITE (#FFFFFF), Bernoru 
     Semicondensed, bold
     Line 3: "Commissioner" — WHITE (#FFFFFF), Bernoru 
     Semicondensed, bold

   LEGIBILITY ON PINK/RED BACKGROUND:
   Since this logo sits on the hero's pink (#FFAEAE) to red 
   (#E92128) gradient background, the red "Democratic Socialist" 
   text may disappear against the background. To solve this, 
   use one of these approaches (in order of preference):

   BEST OPTION — Use the inverted/white version of the logo. 
   On the pink/red hero background, everything should go white, 
   matching how the campaign poster handles branding on red:
   - Speech bubble: WHITE filled bubble, "DAVID!" in red text 
     with subtle shadow
   - "Democratic Socialist" in WHITE
   - "for Hudson County Commissioner" in WHITE
   This is the variant shown on page 5 of the brand guide 
   (red background variant).

   ALTERNATIVE — Place the red speech bubble version on a 
   subtle dark or semi-transparent dark backing/container to 
   match the dark background shown in the reference image. 
   This preserves the red bubble but gives it a dark field 
   to sit on.

   Size: Speech bubble mark approximately 200-240px wide on 
   desktop. Tagline text proportional, roughly 14-16px.
   Left-aligned within the left column.
   This is the first element at the top of the left column.

   Use Intersection Observer: hide or fade the small nav bar 
   DAVID! logo while this hero logo is visible in the viewport. 
   Show the nav logo once the user scrolls past the hero section 
   and this logo leaves the viewport.

   margin-bottom: 32-40px

2. DISTRICT NEIGHBORHOODS
   - Text: "DISTRICT 4 · JOURNAL SQUARE · DOWNTOWN · THE HEIGHTS"
   - Use the shortened version matching the campaign mailer. 
     Keep to one line on desktop.
   - Font: Bernoru Semicondensed, uppercase, letter-spacing 
     slightly widened (tracking +0.05em)
   - Color: white (#FFFFFF) to sit on the pink background. 
     Test legibility — if white is too stark, use #FFF0F0 
     or a very light pink.
   - Size: 14-16px, smaller than the logo tagline text
   - margin-bottom: 20-28px

3. BIO BLURB
   - Full text: "David Sabry Guirgis is a social worker, 
     organizer, and democratic socialist running for Hudson
