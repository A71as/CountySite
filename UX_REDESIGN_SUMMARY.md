### Typography

- Increased base font size from 16px to 18px for better readability
- Line-height of 1.6-1.7 for comfortable reading
- Clear hierarchy with consistent sizing scale

### Touch Targets

- Form labels properly associated with inputs

---

## Mobile Optimizations

### Responsive Breakpoints

```css
sm: 640px   /* Large phones */
md: 768px   /* Tablets */
lg: 1024px  /* Small laptops */
xl: 1280px  /* Desktop */
```

### Mobile-First Improvements

2. **Navigation**: Full-screen overlay menu with large touch targets
3. **Forms**: Full-width inputs, large submit buttons
4. **Cards**: Stack vertically with consistent spacing
5. **Typography**: Slightly smaller headers while maintaining readability

### Lighthouse Scores (Expected)

- **Accessibility**: Improved (better color contrast, larger touch targets)
- **Best Practices**: Maintained
- **SEO**: Maintained

---

## Key Design Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Why Sky Blue + Teal?

**Rationale**: Blue universally signals trust and stability. Teal adds warmth and optimism without political red/blue baggage. The combination feels modern, professional, and hopeful.

**Avoided**: Red (too aggressive, partisan associations), Orange (overly energetic), Purple (too trendy for local government)

### 2. Why Slate Instead of Pure Gray?

**Rationale**: Slate has a subtle blue undertone that harmonizes with the primary palette. Pure grays (#000, #777, #FFF) can feel cold and digital. Slate feels grounded and human.

### 3. Why Multiple Font Weights?

**Rationale**: Creates clear visual hierarchy without needing extreme size differences or color variations. A paragraph with 400 weight body and 600 weight lead text is easier to scan than same weight at different sizes.

### 4. Why Minimal Decorative Elements?

**Rationale**: Local voters are busy. They want information, not entertainment. Every decorative element is cognitive load. We removed anything that didn't serve user goals (understand candidate, get involved, find event).

### 5. Why "Building Together" vs. "Fighting For"?

**Rationale**: Local government is collaborative. County commissioners work with other officials, community groups, and constituents. "Fighting" suggests adversarial politics, which voters find exhausting. "Building" suggests constructive problem-solving.

### 6. Why Soft Shadows vs. Flat Design?

**Rationale**: Completely flat design (no shadows) can feel sterile and hard to scan. Subtle shadows create visual hierarchy and help users understand what's clickable. We chose very light shadows (7-10% opacity) for depth without drama.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Content Audit

1. **Review all copy** through trust-building lens
2. **Replace stock photos** with authentic local photos
3. **Add testimonials** from real community members
4. **Update issues** to be specific to [County] (not national talking points)

### Technical Enhancements

1. **Set up Plausible Analytics** for privacy-respecting metrics
2. **Configure Resend** for email functionality
3. **Add OpenGraph images** for each page/section
4. **Implement structured data** for events (Schema.org)

### Accessibility Testing

1. **Run axe DevTools** on all pages
2. **Test with screen reader** (NVDA or JAWS)
3. **Verify keyboard navigation** on all interactive elements
4. **Check color contrast** in various lighting conditions

### Performance Optimization

1. **Optimize images** (convert to WebP, resize for actual display size)
2. **Implement lazy loading** for below-fold content
3. **Add resource hints** (preconnect, prefetch)
4. **Enable caching** for static assets

### User Testing

1. **Test with 5-10 voters** from target demographic
2. **Ask**: Can you find how to RSVP to an event in under 30 seconds?
3. **Ask**: What are the candidate's top 3 priorities? (Test if Issues section is scannable)
4. **Ask**: How would you describe the candidate's tone? (Test if messaging matches brand)

## Conclusion

This redesign transforms the campaign website from an aggressive political platform into a **trust-building community resource**. Every design decision prioritizes **voter psychology over conversion tactics**, **clarity over cleverness**, and **authenticity over performance**.

The new design positions the candidate as a **capable, community-connected leader** rather than a combative political outsider. It respects voters' intelligence, time, and agency while making it easy to learn about the campaign and get involved.

Most importantly, this design is **sustainable and scalable** - the design system can grow with the campaign without requiring constant redesigns. The clear guidelines in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` ensure future content and features maintain visual consistency and reinforce the trust-building brand.
