# **Inspirations:**

We’re hoping that we can produce a website very similar to Claire Valdez’s website [HERE](https://clairevaldezforcongress.com/). The Major elements that we like about it are:

- Single page scroll through  
- Redirect links to volunteer, about, issues, endorsements, all redirect to their respective parts of the single page instead of new pages  
- Inclusion of clear district map  
- Ability to include donation solicitation pop-ups  
- Video integration  
- Professional look and clean aesthetic  
  - Small touches that add to the professional feel (like the animation that plays when you first load the website)

Other DSA candidate websites:

1. Jake Ephros \- [https://www.jakeforjc.com/](https://www.jakeforjc.com/)  
2. Joel Brooks \- [https://joelforjc.com/](https://joelforjc.com/)   
3. Kelsea Bond \- [https://kelseabond.com/](https://kelseabond.com/) 

# **Project Vision:**

We would like to copy Claire Valdez’s single page scroll-through in an order something like this:

1. Top bar with relevant buttons  
2. Landing page with photo of David Guirgis (DG) and solicitation for people to send us their contact information  
3. DG Bio  
4. WTF is a county commissioner \+ district map  
5. Donation solicitation  
6. Big 3 policies  
   1. Audit everything  
   2. Social housing on county land  
   3. Universal childcare for county kids  
7. Endorsements  
8. End scroll with the same buttons as top bar 

## **Top Bar with relevant buttons (from left to right)**

I really liked the way they gently nudge you toward the volunteer and donate buttons by bolding one and re-coloring the other, I would also like to imitate this

- Volunteer (this is the only one that should link to a different page)  
  - This page should collect more detailed contact information  
  - Full name  
  - Email  
  - Phone number  
  - Request to text  
  - Address  
- WTF is a commissioner (open to dropping this one)  
- issues  
- Endorsements  
- Logo centered  
- Donate

## **Landing page \[if they only see one thing we want it to be this\]**

- Big photo   
- A ‘nice touch’ like an animation(?)  
- Contact info solicitation  
  - First and last name  
  - email  
  - phone  
  - Zip code  
  - Privacy disclosure (small text)  
    - Link to privacy policy  
    - Link to terms of service  
- Short bio blurb

## **DG Bio**

- A more personal photo (maybe grad photo or family photo)  
- Bio text

## **WTF is a county Commissioner \+ district map**

- Description of what a county commissioner does  
- District map (stylized to theme with website if possible)

## **Donation Solicitation**

- Solicitation blurb  
- Link to actblue   
  - I really like that the option you select on her website autofills when you land on her actblue page I would like to imitate this if I can figure out how  
- Photo

## **Big Four policy proposals**

- Audit everything short policy explainer text  
- Social housing short policy explainer text  
- Universal Childcare short policy explainer text  
- Free HCCC  
- Unifying non-generic graphic element  
  - We need to think on this more but it probably just winds up being text-art similar to the Claire Valdez site

## **Endorsements (ready for day 1\)**

Ideally this section would be easy for DG or NN to edit or add to on the fly if/when we get more or bigger endorsements

- DSA image/logo  
- DSA endorsement text blurb  
- WFP image/logo (or NJ equivalent)  
- WFP endorsement text blurb

## **End Scroll**

- Same buttons as top bar (again nudge towards donate and volunteer)  
- Social links (instagram, facebook, others if we set them up)  
- Contact email (hello@davidguirgis.com)  
- Paid for by David Guirgis for Hudson County Commissioner  
- Professional Photography credit
